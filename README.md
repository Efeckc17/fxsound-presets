# 🎷 FxSound Preset Collection

This repository contains a personal collection of `.fac` preset files for [FxSound](https://www.fxsound.com/), tailored for specific genres and listening preferences.

All presets are hand-tuned for clarity, dynamics, and frequency balance.  
They are not professionally engineered — but optimized through careful daily listening.
